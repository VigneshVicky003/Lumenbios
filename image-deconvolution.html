        <p>If you’re familiar with microscopy imaging--particularly fluorescent imaging--you may have heard of
            <b>deconvolution</b> as an image processing technique. But what exactly is deconvolution, and how does it
            work? In
            this article, we’ll cover the basics of deconvolution, methods for deconvolution, and where you can find
            tools to apply deconvolution to your own images.

        <h5>What is Deconvolution?</h5>
        <p>In a nutshell, deconvolution is a post-processing step that makes images appear “sharper,” or more in focus,
            and helps you resolve the finer details of your image.</p>
        <p>When you collect an image with a microscope, the image you get isn’t a perfect representation of your
            sample--it’s distorted, or convoluted, which can make the specimen you’re imaging appear blurry or out of
            focus.</p>
        <p>But let’s say you know exactly how your images are being convoluted by your imaging system. Hypothetically,
            it should be possible to take a final image and “work backwards” to figure out what the original image would
            have looked like pre-convolution.</p>
        <p>This is what deconvolution does--it uses a mathematical algorithm to reverse convolution and generate a
            sharper image. But where does the “convolution” come from, and how can it be reversed?</p>
        <h5>How Does Deconvolution Work?</h5>
        <p>The reason why images become convoluted has to do with the limits of microscopy imaging systems. As light
            passes from your sample through the optical path of the microscope, it spreads out, or becomes
            <b>diffracted</b>.
            This creates <b>blur</b>, which causes the final image to appear less sharp.
        </p>
        <p>Because we understand how our imaging systems work, we can account for blur by modelling light diffraction.
            This is primarily how deconvolution works--by removing blur. (For this reason deconvolution algorithms are
            sometimes known as “deblurring” algorithms.)</p>
        <img src="./assets/pasted image 0.png" alt="">
        <p class="img-desc">Deconvolution works by modeling how images are distorted during acquisition, and removing
            the distortion to estimate what the original sample would have looked like. (Image via Sage 2017)</p>
        <h5>The Point Spread Function</h5>
        <p>To model how blur affects an image, we use a point spread function (<b>PSF</b>). The PSF is simply the
            mathematical
            formula for how light spreads through a system after it is emitted from a certain point, or light source.
        </p>
        <p>Every imaging system has its own PSF, which can change based on the wavelength of light being collected, the
            numerical aperture of your objective lens, and the refractive index of your immersion medium.</p>
        <p>To achieve deconvolution, you typically need to figure out the point spread function of your system. One
            option is to estimate your <b>theoretical PSF</b> based on a mathematical model of your system (using tools
            like a
            <a href="https://svi.nl/NyquistCalculator">PSF Calculator</a>, or the <a
                href="https://imagej.net/plugins/diffraction-psf-3d">Diffraction PSF 3D</a>
            plugin for ImageJ).
        </p>

        <img src="./assets/pasted image 0 (1).png" alt="">
        <p class="img-desc">The PSF describes how your image is affected by blur. (Image via <a
                href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Convolution_Illustrated_eng.png">Wikimedia Commons</a>)
        </p>
        <p>The true PSF of your system, however, can be different from the theoretical estimate, so It’s usually
            recommended that you measure your PSF experimentally. Measuring your <b>empirical PSF</b> involves taking
            images of
            small <a href="https://svi.nl/Recording-Beads">fluorescent beads</a> which act as point sources of light.
            These images can then be used by
            your
            deconvolution software to calculate your PSF.</p>
        <p>Importantly, the PSF for most imaging systems isn’t perfectly uniform--it can vary depending on the imaging
            location, depth, and even over time. Most deconvolution methods assume that the PSF is consistent throughout
            the image, meaning that large variations in the PSF can interfere with the deconvolution process. As we’ll
            see later, current research is focused on finding ways to more accurately estimate and account for
            variations in the PSF.</p>
        <h5>Algorithms for Deconvolution</h5>
        <p>There are a multitude of algorithms out there that can be used to achieve deconvolution. Which one you use
            most often depends on the software: while some programs allow you to choose from a few different methods,
            others use their own proprietary algorithms.</p>
        <p>The first class of algorithms are known as <b>inverse filters</b>, which work by taking an image and using
            the PSF
            to back-calculate what the “original,” or deconvoluted, image would have looked like before blurring. These
            algorithms are the simplest, fastest, and least computationally expensive. However, they are sensitive to
            noise and can introduce more artefacts into the image.</p>
        <p>In addition to inverse filters, there are also <b>iterative</b> algorithms, which work by performing multiple
            iterations to produce a final deconvoluted image. In a nutshell, these algorithms work by estimating the
            original image, blurring it using the point spread function, and comparing the blurred estimate to the real
            image. The estimated image is updated, and the process repeats. Iterative algorithms tend to perform better
            than inverse filters at deconvolution, but are much slower and more computationally intensive [1,2].</p>

        <p class="img-desc">These images, processed using DeconvolutionLab2, illustrate the difference between a raw
            image (A) deconvolved using an inverse filter (B) versus two iterative methods (C) and (D). (Image via Sage
            2017)</p>
        <h5>Blind Deconvolution</h5>
        <p><b>Blind deconvolution</b> algorithms are unique in that they do not require a known PSF--instead, they
            estimate the
            PSF from the input image. Much of the current research in the deconvolution field is focused on developing
            blind deconvolution algorithms for microscopy, mostly by improving the PSF estimation step.</p>
        <p>Blind Deconvolution algorithms have the potential to make deconvolution methods much simpler by removing the
            requirement of figuring out your PSF. However, blind deconvolution is challenging both in concept and in
            practice, and for that reason they’re not yet widely available.</p>
        <h5>Why do Biologists use Deconvolution?</h5>
        <p>In addition to improving the appearance of fluorescent images, deconvolution can help biologists to
            distinguish small or subcellular structures by improving image resolution.</p>
        <p>Although deconvolution is typically applied to wide field fluorescence microscopy, it also has applications
            in confocal microscopy, light sheet imaging, and structured illumination microscopy.</p>
        <p>In wide field imaging, the objective takes in all the fluorescent light that is emitted from the sample--even
            the light that is not currently in focus. This leads to more out of focus light in the image, and more
            blurring. The additional out of focus light can be removed with deconvolution.</p>
        <p>Confocal microscopes are designed to capture higher-resolution images than wide field microscopes--they use a
            pinhole to remove light that is not in focus. However, blur can still affect images captured by confocal
            microscopes, particularly when imaging thick specimens, and can still be improved by deconvolution methods.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, even though we tend to think of advanced imaging methods like light sheet imaging and structured
            illumination microscopy to be extremely high resolution already, researchers have developed deconvolution
            methods for these systems as well [3,4].</p>
        <h5>How can AI be used for Deconvolution?</h5>
        <p>The challenges posed by deconvolution--especially to the problem of variable PSFs--has led to the idea to
            apply deep learning to deconvolution.</p>
        <p>Most deep learning-based approaches to deconvolution attempt to use a Convolutional Neural Network to account
            for aberrations and estimate a more accurate PSF, before applying a more “conventional” deconvolution
            algorithm [5-8].</p>
        <p>However, the biggest opportunity for deep learning in the deconvolution field lies in blind deconvolution and
            the estimation of point spread functions from already-convoluted images. Since as early as 2010 algorithms
            have been under development to better estimate PSFs for blind deconvolution [9]. Since then, the research
            into deep learning-based blind convolution has continued, using Convolutional Neural Networks as well as
            other methods [10-13]. Even though blind deconvolution is still a challenging problem, this research could
            lead us to faster, more accurate, and more user friendly methods for deconvolution in the future.</p>
        <h5>Tools for Biologists to do Deconvolution</h5>
        <p>If you’re interested in getting started with deconvolution using your own images, you can find a number of
            options for software, both free and for purchase.</p>
        <p>The most popular open-source softwares for deconvolution are ImageJ plugins, particularly <a
                href="http://bigwww.epfl.ch/deconvolution/deconvolutionlab2/">DeconvolutionLab2</a>
            (which can also be used with Matlab or as a stand-alone program) [1]. This plugin allows you to choose from
            a variety of algorithms, both linear and iterative.</p>
        <p>Additionally, one can use the <a href="https://www.optinav.info/Iterative-Deconvolve-3D.htm">Iterative
                Deconvolve</a> plugin, paired with the <a

            for
            generating a theoretical PSF.</p>
